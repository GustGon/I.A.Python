Artificial neural networks:

My day by day use for artificial neural network.

After pay atention on the first class of artificial neural networks that talked about a introduction of what is it and what is it for
came on my mind some ideias of how to use this on my day by day work. One of this ideias is a log analyzer, in a cellphone existe a lot
of logs for every diferent type of problems. One of the ideias is to use the logs of problems alredy solved seperade by categories for exemple
power, wifi, bluetooth, audio, system... With this logs train a supervisioned NN to analyze it and at last help to decreasse the time spent on the log analyze
and if possible show the line of the log that shows the problem rapend.

Other ideia is to use a unsupervised neural network with a lot of logs from diferente problems without say whats ir the problem of each log
and the trained NN show me wich logs are a similar, this will help to try same resolution for similars type of log decreasing the time spent.
